This is my summer intern project in SRS Pharmacy:

Official Online Grocery Store

It can provide user general function like upload stuff info for sale
and Admin function like user stuff category management.

I did not install all library in this folder, so when you clone this,
make sure add environment variable the node bin folder, and in this ogs folder, use:
npm install \n
npm install pg
